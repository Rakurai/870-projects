Project description:

For the clock, I chose to completely separate the sumOfTicks from the actual clock ticks.  I also changed pause/unpause to togglePause, and made it a Meyers singleton.  F3 will toggle slow motion, and P toggles pause.  I
also used a vector of timing samples for smoothing the animation, to maintain a consistent FPS.

I took a photo of Dr. Malloy's sushi restaurant, and traced it using Photoshop to make the line drawing.  I
created the California rolls and chopsticks by hand.  Both use the same vector of Sprite objects for drawing.

I was having some trouble with the Makefile on my Mac, so rather than mess it up for the grader, I made a new one.
The original Makefile is in Makefile.old.

Everything else is as per instructions.
