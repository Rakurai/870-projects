Just a singleton Catalog class that stores Items in a vector.
  * Item has a string name, some heap bytes, and is canonical.
  * Item also overloads the output operator.
  * string is mostly like the given version, but uses a Meyers assignment
    and overloads the == operator for comparisons
  * Catalog allows searching by name or price of items, and fills a vector passed
    by reference rather than returning a heaped vector (I don't like allocating
    memory that the caller is responsible for deleting if I can help it)
